AverageWeeklyDemand_PerStore -- the "true" demand, on average, each week for the product at a given store; the average must trim the initial weeks from the sequence that don't have an order; and must trim final weeks that have an order (this can only be done if there are any gaps seen in the sequence).

CurrentStockBasedOnWeeklyDemand -- Defined as: LastOrderCount - (WeeksSinceLastOrder * AverageWeeklyDemand_PerStore)  [assuming 1-based]; this actually assumes there is a trigger threshold amount that remains unseen within the stock levels
